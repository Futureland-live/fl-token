# FL-Token
Governance (Fungible) token base of Futureland's tokenomics. Futureland's team is working on defining the business model and token distribution process to create a incentivized economy with as less flaws as we can - avoiding web3 attacks and assuring security for all users and developers

# Description
This code is an implementation of a reference project (found here: https://github.com/near-examples/FT) which is building a crypto currency - a.k.a. fungible token - using NEAR protocol in the NEAR testnet

This is one of the 2 or 3 tokens (still in technical analysis) that Futureland platform will have to organize and setup the incentives necessary for the business model
